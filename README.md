## Premise
Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe is played on a meta 3x3 grid consisting of nine smaller 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe boards. Players take turns, aiming to win smaller grids by getting three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) within them. The move within a small grid determines the opponent's next move in a corresponding small grid. To win the game, a player must secure three small grids in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
